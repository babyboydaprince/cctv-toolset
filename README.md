## 🚀 Usage

### 🧪 RTSP Connection Test

This option tests the connectivity to the specified RTSP server 
and displays the server's response.

```bash
  python app/CCTV-Toolset.py -t <target-ip> -p <target-port> --connection-test
```

-   **`<target-ip>`:** The IP address of the RTSP server.
-   **`<target-port>`:** The port number of the RTSP server (typically 554 or 8554).

**Example:**

```bash
  python app/CCTV-Toolset.py -t 192.168.1.100 -p 554 --connection-test
```

### 🔑 RTSP authentication tester

This option performs various attempts onto the specified RTSP server, 
attempting to find valid credentials combinations, just so it's possible to guarantee
that the secure authentication method/logic is robust and does not leak data or credentials.

```bash
  python app/CCTV-Toolset.py -t <target-ip> -p <target-port> -u <username> -pl <password-wordlist> -o <output-path> -fn <output-filename>
```

or

```bash
  python app/CCTV-Toolset.py -t <target-ip> -p <target-port> -ul <user-wordlist> -pl <password-wordlist> -o <output-path> -fn <output-filename> -d <delay>
```

-   **`<target-ip>`:** The IP address of the RTSP server.
-   **`<target-port>`:** The port number of the RTSP server.
-   **`<username>`:** (Optional) A single username to try.
-   **`<user-wordlist>`:** (Optional) Path to a wordlist file containing usernames.
-   **`<password-wordlist>`:** Path to a wordlist file containing passwords.
-   **`<output-path>`:** The directory where the output file will be saved.
-   **`<output-filename>`:** The name of the file to save successful credentials.
-   **`<delay>`:** (Optional) Time in seconds to wait between each attempt (Default: 2 seconds).

**Examples:**

```bash
  Brute-force with a single username
  python app/CCTV-Toolset.py -t 192.168.1.100 -p 8554 -u admin -pl passwords.txt -o /tmp -fn cctv-credentials
```

```bash
  Brute-force with a user wordlist
  python app/CCTV-Toolset.py -t 192.168.1.100 -p 554 -ul users.txt -pl passwords.txt -o /tmp -fn cctv-credentials -d 1.5
```
